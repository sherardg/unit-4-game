Crystal Collectors Game (Unit-4-game)

Here's how you play the game
You will be given a random number at the start of the game "Number To Get".
By clicking on a crystal, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
You win the game by matching your total score to the "Number To Get".
You lose the game if your total score goes above the "Number To Get".
The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

This was a fun game to create and have my kids to try.
